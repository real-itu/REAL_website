I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering and a Master's in Digital Signal Processing. I co-founded a startup dedicated to computer vision for CNC engraving machine automation, an experience that truly broadened my horizons. My previous research focused on Visual Quality Assessment at NTNU, where I contributed to the development of advanced visual recognition techniques.

During my time as a Research Assistant at Aalborg University, I specialized in object detection and action recognition for sports video analysis.

My journey led me to Denmark with my wife, where I am currently pursuing my PhD at ITU. My research centers on non-verbal emotional cues, primarily through eye tracking, with the goal of enhancing emotion recognition in human-agent dialogue.

Additionally, I hold the role of board member and ITU representative at the PhD Association Network of Denmark.
