I'm a husband and dad of two, who recently decided to deviate from my professional career to pursue an academic career instead.

I have worked as a professional developer for more than ten years. I have worked in various industries like mobility, finance, hosting and security.

In the summer of 2022 I received my masters degree in Games from ITU and immediately applied for an PhD project which I started mid August 2022.
The subject of the project is to optimize learning for young children with adaptive games, player modeling and procedural content generation.

In my spare time I teach children how to code and make games as a volunteer at [Coding Pirates](https://codingpirates.dk/) - Ballerup.
